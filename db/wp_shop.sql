(<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28785">#28785</a>, <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27440">#27440</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Selecting a language</strong> when you run the installation process. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28577">#28577</a>)</li>\n<li>The <strong>editor</strong> intelligently resizes and its top and bottom bars pin when needed. Browsers don&#8217;t like to agree on where to put things like cursors, so if you find a bug here, please also let us know your browser and operating system. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28328">#28328</a>)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve made some improvements to how your keyboard and cursor interact with <strong>TinyMCE views</strong> such as the gallery preview. Much like the editor resizing and scrolling improvements, knowing about your setup is particularly important for bug reports here. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28595">#28595</a>)</li>\n<li><strong>Widgets in the Customizer</strong> are now loaded in a separate panel. (<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27406">#27406</a>)</li>\n<li>We&#8217;ve also made some changes to some <strong>formatting</strong> functions, so if you see quotes curling in the wrong direction, please file a bug report.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

(For example: <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/15/html5-galleries-captions-in-wordpress-3-9/">HTML5</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/14/symlinked-plugins-in-wordpress-3-9/">symlinks</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/07/mysql-in-wordpress-3-9/">MySQL</a>, <a href="//make.wordpress.org/core/2014/04/11/plupload-2-x-in-wordpress-3-9/">Plupload</a>.)</p>\n<p>To test WordPress 3.9 RC2, try the <a href="//wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want “bleeding edge nightlies”).

We&#8217;re sorry we let you down.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve all lost words we&#8217;ve written before, like an email thanks to a cat on the keyboard or a term paper to a blue screen of death. Over the last few WordPress releases, we&#8217;ve made a number of improvements to features like autosaves and revisions. With revisions, an old edit can always be restored. We&#8217;re trying our hardest to save your content somewhere even if your power goes out or your browser crashes. We even monitor your internet connection and prevent you from hitting that &#8220;Publish&#8221; button at the exact moment the coffee shop Wi-Fi has a hiccup.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s <em>possible</em> that the quick draft you lost last week is still in the database, and just hidden from view. As an added complication, these &#8220;discarded drafts&#8221; normally get deleted after seven days, and it&#8217;s already been six days since the release. If we were able to rescue your draft, you&#8217;ll see it on the &#8220;All Posts&#8221; screen after you update to 3.8.3. (We&#8217;ll also be pushing 3.8.3 out as a background update, so you may just see a draft appear.)</p>\n<p>So, if you tried to jot down a quick idea last week, I hope WordPress has recovered it for you.

The group connects WordPress enthusiasts in the area for relaxed chats and presentations. As of last month, <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-in-vietnamese-now-100-translated" target="_blank">WordPress is now 100% translated into Vietnamese</a>, and some of the meetup members were active in helping to reach that goal.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Hanoi is set to have three presentation tracks to include the business side of WordPress, using WordPress, and developing for WordPress.

Some of the clunkier solutions actually require you to look up longitude and latitude coordinates to manually input for pinpointing. Very few maps plugins utilize custom post types to provide a user-friendly input.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/stellar-places/" target="_blank">Stellar Places</a> is a new plugin designed to provide an intuitive way to create, manage and display locations in WordPress. The plugin registers a custom post type for locations with integrated Google maps. Once activated, a new Places menu shows up in the WordPress admin:</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/places.png" rel="prettyphoto[27252]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/places.png?resize=900%2C374" alt="places" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27287" /></a></p>\n<p>Scroll down to enter location data, which is pulled in via Google Maps. You can enter an exact address, just the cross streets, exact coordinates, etc. There&#8217;s a good deal of flexibility in entering a location to pinpoint. The map and extra data fields are automatically updated with your location, without refreshing the page.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/google-map.png" rel="prettyphoto[27252]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/google-map.png?resize=900%2C644" alt="google-map" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27290" /></a></p>\n<p>Places added can be accessed on the front end via the location listing view or single location view with the associated maps. Maps can be inserted into a page or post using the <code>[stellar_places_map]</code> shortcode. Stellar Places also allows you to display multiple locations on the same map.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maps-frontend.png" rel="prettyphoto[27252]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/maps-frontend.png?resize=1025%2C501" alt="maps-frontend" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27294" /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/stellar-places/faq/" target="_blank">shortcode for embedding places</a> is extremely customizable and includes parameters for customizing HTML attributes, such as ID, class, width, and height. It also includes query parameters for limiting the display by post_type, taxonomy, term, category, and post_id. Shortcode map settings allow you to specify latitude/longitude for the map center, mapType, scrollwheel, zoom, minzoom, maxzoom, and infowindows.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/responsive-map.png" rel="prettyphoto[27252]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/responsive-map.png?resize=248%2C500" alt="responsive-map" class="alignright size-large wp-image-27297" /></a>The plugin is also mobile-friendly and produces responsive maps that are easy to navigate on devices. This makes it ideal for featuring local events, divided by categories. You could also use it to create a store locator for businesses that have multiple physical locations. Each location gets its own dedicated page and will automatically appear in the list of all locations.</p>\n<p>Stellar places features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Live map preview</li>\n<li>Drag and drop marker relocation</li>\n<li>Location pages for better SEO</li>\n<li>Unlimited locations and maps</li>\n<li>Mobile friendly, responsive maps</li>\n<li>Easy map embeds via a customizable shortcode</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the future, the <a href="http://stellarplaces.com/" target="_blank">Stellar Places development team</a> plans to build extensions for the plugin that you can install to gain additional functionality.</p>\n<p>An easy-to-use maps plugin that looks and feels like native WordPress is long overdue. I tested Stellar Places and found that it works as advertised. The process of adding new places is intuitive and maps can be tailored to your exact specifications with the many options available in the shortcode.

Griffiths is best known for his work as an <a href="http://easydigitaldownloads.com/" target="_blank">Easy Digital Downloads</a> extension developer and is also the founder of the <a href="http://reduxframework.com/" target="_blank">Redux Framework</a>. During the course of his work, he found migrations to be a source of continual frustration for the average WordPress user.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea came about as a direct result of a series of issues posted in the Easy Digital Downloads support forum related to migration issues experienced by one of our users,&#8221; Griffiths said. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">I came to the realization that no matter how well documented, migrations suck!</span> Even for someone who’s done a few, they’re a headache and for a new user, they’re downright impossible.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>A Hands-On Migration Service with No Automation</h3>\n<p>After researching the problem, Griffiths found that there are very few resources available to facilitate site migration, let alone conversion, for end users who aren&#8217;t technically inclined. <strong>&#8220;Yes, there are a few other services, but they all suffer from one fatal flaw: automation,&#8221;</strong> he said. &#8220;MigrateWP was built on the premise that no matter how well thought out, automated systems can&#8217;t compare with the reliability that manual processes can.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Griffiths hand-tailors the migration process for each user&#8217;s unique scenario, and all migrations are completed hands-on by specialists with a high level of experience. This enables MigrateWP employees to ensure data integrity and customer satisfaction.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Beyond the basic migration component, we do site conversions, full site auditing, and every migration is run through malware checks both before and after the migration process to ensure the client receives a clean site when the process is finished,&#8221; Griffiths said.</p>\n<p>Customers often have no idea how much information they will need to provide access to in the course of a migration. I asked Griffiths how he plans to simplify the process of interfacing with his clients&#8217; old and new hosts. &#8220;Before the migration begins, we personally contact every client to work out the details of the migration,&#8221; he said. However, the initial contact on the website is designed to be quick, without attempting to capture all of the information required.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our client contact form is extremely simple for a reason,&#8221; Griffiths said. &#8220;Particularly in the case of companies, it’s unreasonable to expect a single individual to know all the details up front. After all, companies frequently have multiple employees responsible for various facets of their tech. This may well include different people responsible for the physical hardware as opposed to software, or corporate staff changeovers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Griffiths&#8217; team first performs a site review and engages each potential client directly to get a grasp of the actual migration before proceeding. He is aiming to hire a 5-10 person staff within the first year.</p>\n<p>In the future, he hopes to attract developers to utilize his service, in addition to assisting end users who don&#8217;t have the skills to migrate their own sites. Any capable WordPress developer should be able to easily handle an average site migration, but Griffiths hopes to free up their time by creating agreements with development agencies or hosting providers to manage their client migrations.</p>\n<p>The commitment to provide a more personalized migration experience with no automation is what Griffiths hopes will distinguish <a href="http://migratewp.io/" target="_blank">MigrateWP</a> from its competitors. Many hosts already offer free automated migration when you sign up for a new account. Do you think end users are more likely to utilize a dedicated migration service or will MigrateWP find more success among developers and agencies?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 18:12:50 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"Lorelle on WP: Code Standards Project to Take WordPress Into the Future";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/?p=11770";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/code-standards-project-to-take-wordpress-into-the-future/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:525:"WP Tavern reported recently that WordPress Developers are organizing a community initiative to standardize common post types, taxonomies and meta data.

This morning&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/_s/commit/55085b74a34097026711e33b5342b55ac2f5cafd">commit</a> by Tammie Lister follows a number of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/_s/pull/410">much-discussed Github threads</a>, and it looks promising. The Sassy version of Underscores is <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/_s/tree/_sass">in its own branch</a>, if you want to explore it further and get started with that version right away.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been using my own forked version of Underscores for some time now, that includes Sass, and I&#8217;m happy to see this change. I look forward to comparing their version with my own and learning from it. Underscores has become one of the most popular WordPress themes to build custom websites from, and this is a great change.</p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re ready for Sass, Josh Pollock has a <a href="http://torquemag.io/developers-guide-learning-sass-twenty-minutes-less/">nice post on Torque</a> to help you out.</p>\n<h3>Custom post type standards are underway</h3>\n<p>After my post recommending that Jetpack <a title="WordPress.com and Jetpack should lead the way toward standardizing custom post types" href="http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-com-jetpack-lead-way-toward-standardizing-custom-post-types/">lead the way for standardizing custom post types</a>, Justin Tadlock wrote <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2014/07/25/custom-post-type-standards">an excellent follow-up piece</a>.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, he started a Github repo for a <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/content-type-standards">community-based, unofficial standards document</a>. This is exactly the type of discussion that I hoped would occur, and I encourage you all to get involved. If enough of us encourage standards for some common custom content types, we can make portability between WordPress themes even better, and that would be great.</p>\n<p>The first issue is to decide what post types to standardize, so <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/content-type-standards/issues/1">go get involved</a>.</p>\n<h3>Standard site logo support for the customizer</h3>\n<p>Also along the standardization theme, WordPress.com has introduced a feature for theme developers to create <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-moves-to-standardize-theme-support-for-logos">standard support for site logos</a>, a feature that&#8217;s in almost any WordPress theme.</p>\n<p>The feature is live on WordPress.com, and coming to a Jetpack near you. WordPress.com <a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/site-logo/">added support for about a dozen themes</a> for the launch of the feature.</p>\n<h3>MailPoet and Sucuri spar over the handling of security disclosures</h3>\n<p>On July 1st, Sucuri <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/remote-file-upload-vulnerability-on-mailpoet-wysija-newsletters.html">disclosed a vulnerability in MailPoet</a>, a very popular WordPress-centric newsletter plugin. Over the next few days, <a href="http://www.mailpoet.com/critical-security-update-mailpoet-2-6-7/">MailPoet released a variety of updates</a>. A <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2458080/thousands-of-sites-compromised-through-wordpress-plugin-vulnerability.html">bunch</a> of WordPress websites were estimated to be hacked. Updates were available, and many hosts made server level changes, but it affected every version and was a serious issue.<span id="more-6979"></span></p>\n<p>However, MailPoet was unsatisfied with how Sucuri handled the disclosure, and <a href="http://www.mailpoet.com/sucuri-hack-lessons-learned/">posted some lessons learned</a> on their blog a couple of days ago. That post is worth reading on its own, but essentially they&#8217;re displeased at the rapidity of Sucuri&#8217;s actions from notification of the vulnerability to publishing the news on their blog. Sucuri says it was standard practice, and <a href="http://blog.sucuri.net/2014/07/responsible-disclosure-sucuri-open-letter-to-mailpoet-and-future-disclosures.html">give a rundown in an open letter to MailPoet</a> on their own blog.</p>\n<p>When your primary software product has something like this happen, your emotions definitely tick up a notch or three. I can see both sides of this story. In the end, it&#8217;s important that the fix gets in and site owners and hosts get notified so they can get their sites fixed. I don&#8217;t know who is more correct in this story (I haven&#8217;t given it enough thought, honestly), but I think most things are better settled in a different venue than trading accusatory and pointed open letters &#8212; something both parties are guilty of here.</p>\n<h3>Starting a WordPress blog?</h3>\n<p>Oli Dale has some really interesting insight where he raises the hypothetical, &#8220;<a href="http://wplift.com/start-blog-wordpress-today">If I were to start a blog about WordPress today.</a>&#8221; He highlights how he thinks some genres (like WordPress news) are well covered, but that he sees a great deal of potential in more niche markets.</p>\n<p>Definitely read Oli&#8217;s advice if you&#8217;re looking to start a blog. Also keep in mind, really there is so much opportunity, no matter what you see out there today; just do it better than anyone else and you can succeed. (Notable on this topic, <a href="http://wpscoop.com/version-2-0/">WP Scoop</a> just rebranded itself)</p>\n<p>Related, but more general: <a href="https://medium.com/message/you-are-not-late-b3d76f963142">You are not late</a>.</p>\n<h3>GravityView: display entries of Gravity Forms anywhere on your site</h3>\n<p>Zack Katz has released <a href="http://gravityview.co/">GravityView</a>, a plugin that takes Gravity Forms submissions and lets you put them anywhere on your site. This plugin look really slick, and I see a lot of potential uses for it.</p>\n<p>Zack is the developer of the free <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-addons/">Gravity Forms Directory</a> plugin, and GravityView is a different plugin, but expanded version of that. Zack talks about GravityView and his thinking behind it on the <a href="http://applyfilters.fm/podcast/episode-22/">latest Apply Filters podcast</a>, which he recorded right before he released the plugin.</p>\n<h3>Automating WP App Store</h3>\n<p>Iain Poulson wrote a fun little post about how he&#8217;s <a href="http://polevaultweb.com/2014/07/workflow-automation-wp-app-store/">automated most of the work that goes into WP App Store</a>, a former marketplace product <a title="WP App Store has a new owner" href="http://www.poststat.us/wp-app-store-new-owner/">turned email deals product</a>.</p>\n<h3>Brian Richards goes full-time on WP Sessions, introduces first course</h3>\n<p>Brian Richards has left his position at WebDevStudios to attempt a full-time career building WP Sessions, his WordPress learning website.</p>\n<p>As I noted last week, he&#8217;s giving away a $2,000 value trip to WCSF to those that sign up for his VIP program, and there are <a href="http://wpsessions.com/great-big-give-away/">still a couple of days to enter</a>.</p>\n<p>He also just released a <a href="http://wpsessions.com/course/first-wordpress-plugin/">course on building WordPress plugins</a>, <a href="https://pippinsplugins.com/first-wordpress-plugin-course-wp-sessions/">which Pippin Williamson is teaching</a>; it doesn&#8217;t get much better than that. I wish Brian the best of luck, and hope WP Sessions sustains him.</p>\n<h3>My first WordCap San Francisco</h3>\n<p>I guest posted on the WordCamp San Francisco blog, where I talked about my first experience at WCSF. Incredible relationships and experiences are made at WordCamps; <a href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/2014/07/21/my-first-wordcamp-san-francisco/">this is my story</a>.</p>\n<p>Along a similar vein, <a href="http://bluelimemedia.com/2014/07/27/bother-wordcamps/">Christine Rondeau answers</a>, &#8220;Why bother with WordCamps?&#8221;</p>\n<h3>Meet me in New York</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m really excited to attend <a href="http://2014.nyc.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp New York City</a> Friday through Sunday. If you&#8217;re there, I&#8217;d love to meet. The lineup of <a href="http://2014.nyc.wordcamp.org/attendees">attendees</a> and <a href="http://2014.nyc.wordcamp.org/speakers">speakers</a> is insane. I&#8217;ll also be doing some hallway interviews, so Post Status readers will hopefully enjoy the results of those. I&#8217;ll probably be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PHOeXIPNZE">singing Alicia Keys to myself</a> for the next few days, so you can have that mental image for free.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not quite midnight on Monday in Alabama, as I wrap this up. So while the week in review is a bit late this week, I hope you still enjoyed it and learned something new. If you did, I of course appreciate if you&#8217;ll share it with your social network of choice.</p>\n<p>Have a great week everyone.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Jul 2014 04:31:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"WPTavern: This Week On WPWeekly – A Roundtable Discussion On Crowdfunding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=26916";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:186:"http://wptavern.com/this-week-on-wpweekly-a-roundtable-discussion-on-crowdfunding?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=this-week-on-wpweekly-a-roundtable-discussion-on-crowdfunding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2221:"<p>This <a title="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly" href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-weekly">Friday at 3PM Eastern</a>, we&#8217;ll be joined by three individuals to discuss the topic of crowdfunding.

Justin Tadlock is spearheading an <a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/493083812683718656" target="_blank">initiative</a> to create WordPress community-curated standards for common post types, taxonomies, and metadata.</p>\n<p>WordPress developers are invited to join the discussion taking place in the <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/content-type-standards" target="_blank">Content Type Standards</a> repo on Github where Tadlock outlined the objective: <strong>&#8220;The purpose of this repository is to create an open set of standards for the WordPress developer community on how to name custom post types as well as related taxonomies and metadata.&#8221;</strong> This would include common post types, such as testimonials, portfolios, recipes, FAQ, events, and products.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contnet-type-standards.png" rel="prettyphoto[27183]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/contnet-type-standards.png?resize=1025%2C687" alt="contnet-type-standards" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27240" /></a></p>\n<p>Tadlock, who has historically been a vocal advocate of <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2013/09/14/why-custom-post-types-belong-in-plugins" target="_blank">data portability</a>, is hoping that the standards will enable users to painlessly switch between plugins that compete in the same space, without losing any data. Standards will also make it easier for developers to build extensions in such a way that they can be more widely adopted by theme developers. He identifies a few benefits that both users and developers would enjoy as a result of content type standards:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Less worry about what to name things when creating a plugin.</li>\n<li>We can have competing plugins in the same space.</li>\n<li>Cool things like add-on plugins become easier to build.</li>\n<li>Users can switch between similar plugins to find the one they like best.</li>\n<li>It would be easier to push for things in core WP like custom Dashicons.</li>\n<li>Theme authors could potentially support multiple plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The project will first be focused on establishing a set of standards for plugin authors to follow, based on the core WordPress methods. Tadlock also suggests a secondary goal of creating a few PHP scripts for developers to copy/paste for registering a post type or taxonomy that make use of the new standards.</p>\n<h3>The Need for a Community-Curated Initiative</h3>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard recently published an <a href="http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-com-jetpack-lead-way-toward-standardizing-custom-post-types/" target="_blank">article</a> calling for Jetpack and WordPress.com to lead the way toward standardizing custom post types. While Jetpack and WordPress.com are in a good position to lead the way on this, there are many community developers outside of Automattic who have valuable input to offer on the creation of a truly open set of standards.</p>\n<p>In a recent article that <a href="http://justintadlock.com/archives/2014/07/25/custom-post-type-standards" target="_blank">outlines the need for custom post type standards</a>, Tadlock argues that standardization goes far beyond simple naming conventions:</p>\n<blockquote><p>People are still using their own, separate code rather than adopting existing solutions, preferring a solution built in-house instead of joining together with others. That’s the reason we don’t have standards. It really has little to do with post type naming conventions.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea behind the community-curated standards is to help WordPress developers work together without the need to reinvent the wheel every time with their own solutions. Instead of closing off products with naming conventions that won&#8217;t be able to transfer users&#8217; data, Tadlock encourages developers to work on creating plugins that become standards in their own right.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Standards are created after we&#8217;ve made them and they’ve been adopted by enough people.

SSH stands for &#8220;Secure Shell&#8221; and enabling SSH for a server creates a secure channel between you (via the command line) and your server.</p>\n<p>SSH keys help the server validate and authenticate who you are. SSH servers can even be setup to require a known valid SSH key in order for the server to acknowledge you to begin the login process.</p>\n<p>Using SSH from a Linux or Mac system is straightforward. You may not realize it but your system will automagically generate an SSH key for you the first time you use SSH if you do not have one already. This key will then be sent with all subsequent request to that server and all other servers. This is a great start, however it is possible to maintain multiple SSH keys on your system.</p>\n<p>If the one SSH key allows you to get into all your systems why would you want additional keys? Simple, extra security.</p>\n<p>Having a unique key per system you are logging into will create additional security by only allowing that key to be used on that system and no other. If your account somehow gets compromised and the key to the server taken you do not have to worry about all the systems you have logged into with that key and remember to go secure them. You simply delete the key for that system and generate another.</p>\n<p>Managing multiple keys is easy. Let me show you how you can accomplish this on your own system.</p>\n<p>This tutorial assumes you have basic knowledge of the command line. It was originally written as <a href="https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CLI-Cheat-Sheet">part of a series</a> of CLI (command line interface) cheat sheets, and I&#8217;m reposting it here so that a broader audience can take advantage of SSH for server management. The CLI cheat sheet has other excellent resources I recommend you check out as well.</p>\n<h3>Where to find SSH files</h3>\n<p>All the SSH files live in a hidden folder <code>.ssh</code> in your user directory. If your system is using the generic key file this folder may not exist. You can safely create this folder yourself. We will be working out of it for the remainder of this tutorial.</p>\n<p>We will also be working from the terminal for the rest of this process.</p>\n<p>Open up your terminal and get setup.</p>\n<p><code>cd ~/.ssh</code></p>\n<p>If you get an error that the directory does not exist create it with:</p>\n<p><code>mkdir ~/.ssh</code></p>\n<h3>Lets make some keys!</h3>\n<p><span id="more-6970"></span></p>\n<p>For this example we will setup keys for two servers: abc.com and xyz.com.</p>\n<p>SSH includes a simple utility for creating SSH keys called `<code>ssh-keygen</code>. The following is an example of what creating a key would look like.</p>\n<pre><code>blobaugh@devbox$ ssh-keygen\nGenerating public/private rya key pair.\nEnter file in which to save the key (/Users/blobaugh/.ssh/id_rsa): [id_rsa.abc.com]\nEnter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Enter a passphrase]\nEnter same passphrase again: [Repeat passphrase]\nYour identification has been saved in /Users/blobaugh/.ssh/id_rsa.abc.com\nYour public key has been saved in /Users/blobaugh/.ssh/id_rsa.abc.com.pub\nThe key fingerprint is:\n[Long crazy string]\nThe key’s random art image is:\n[Cool ascii art]\n</code></pre>\n<p>Type <code>ls</code> into the terminal and you should now see two new key files that have been created for abc.com. Repeat the process with xyz.com.</p>\n<p>Passphrases are recommended but not strictly necessary. If you are creating a passwordless login you can hit enter to leave it blank. Later on when we get into the configuration file there are additional login options you can set.</p>\n<p>Since you are now a pro at creating SSH keys I suggest you also create a generic key. This key will be used on any systems you login to where you do not have a unique key created.</p>\n<h3>Setup the configuration file</h3>\n<p>Likely there will not be a configuration file in your <code>.ssh</code> directory. This is normal. You will create it in this step.</p>\n<p>To utilize your shiny new SSH key with a specific system you will need to create a new entry into the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file related to that host. You can use either the hostname or the IP. One key can have multiple entries, so if you have multiple hostnames for one system, or want to use both the hostname and IP to login simply create an additional entry in the config file. The * wildcard can also be used.</p>\n<p>To get started open the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file in your editor of choice and add the following lines:</p>\n<pre><code>Host abc.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.abc.com\n\nHost xyz.com\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.xyz.com\n</code></pre>\n<p>That is it! You will now be utilizing a different key for each of those hosts.</p>\n<p>Setup the generic key with</p>\n<pre><code>Host *\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.generic\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Configuration options</h3>\n<p>There are many configuration options available to you in this file. Lets break down a few here.</p>\n<p><strong>Host</strong><br />\nThe Host option is a bit tricky. Host is for the name you use on the command line with the ssh command. This does not have to be a real machine but can be an alias. When used as an alias you need to supply the HostName option as well. Here are a couple examples to help make this more clear.</p>\n<pre><code>Host lobaugh.net\n    ….\n</code></pre>\n<p>On the command line you would use <code>ssh yahoo.com</code> to connect to the machine still.</p>\n<pre><code>Host ben\n    HostName lobaugh.net\n    ….\n</code></pre>\n<p>In this example you would call <code>ssh ben</code> and still be connected to the lobaugh.net server.</p>\n<p><strong>User</strong><br />\nAllows you to set the username that is supplied to the connection by default. This can be different than the currently logged in user that is supplied by the system if one is not supplied. This setting can be overwritten at run time on the command line.</p>\n<pre><code>Host lobaugh.net\n    User ben\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>ServerAliveInterval</strong><br />\nSome servers have a timeout setting that will automatically disconnect a user if they do not perform an action for a specified period of time. This is great for security, however some hosts are a bit aggressive with disconnects and will bump you rather quickly (looking at you MediaTemple). This option tells your client to send keep alive packets to the server so you do not get disconnected too quickly. This setting is in seconds.</p>\n<pre><code>Host lobaugh.net\n    ServerAliveInterval 60\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>IdentityFile</strong><br />\nThis is the key file we created in the beginning that should be used for the connection.</p>\n<pre><code>Host lobaugh.net\n    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa.lobaugh.net\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Port</strong></p>\n<p>Allows changing the port number the connection uses for non-standard ports.</p>\n<pre><code>Host lobaugh.net\n    Port 5000\n</code></pre>\n<p>A complete list of configuration options can be found at <a href="http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?topic=ssh_config">http://www.gsp.com/cgi-bin/man.cgi?topic=ssh_config</a></p>\n<h3>Setup the server side of things</h3>\n<p>Now that we have things on the client side setup we need to let the server know what is happening. This will ensure that the server knows who we are. This is as simple as ensuring the public key is present in the authorized_keys file.</p>\n<p>We will use a couple “magic” ssh commands that run remote commands on the server for us.</p>\n<p>First we need to ensure the .ssh directory exists on the server or the transfer of the key will fail.</p>\n<pre><code>ssh USER@SERVER mkdir ~/.ssh\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we will send the <strong>public</strong> key to the server.</p>\n<pre><code>cat .ssh/KEY_FILE.pub | ssh USER@SERVER ‘cat &gt;&gt; .ssh/authorized_keys’\n</code></pre>\n<p>You are now all set with multiple unique keys per machine you are connecting into, complete with verification of the key on the server side of things.</p>\n<hr />\n<div id="single-hcard-benlobaugh" class="loop-meta vcard"><h4 class="author-bio fn n">Ben Lobaugh</h4><div class="author-description"><img alt="Ben Lobaugh" src="http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/f25f324a47a1efdf7a745e0b2e3c878f?s=150&d=http%3A%2F%2F1.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D150&r=G" class="avatar avatar-150 photo" height="150" width="150" /><div class="user-bio author-bio">Ben is an Automattician working on Team Jetpack, as well as a musician, a sailor, and Seattle WordCamp co-organizer.

Version 1.1.1 includes a fix for a vulnerability wherein the JSONP support built-in to the API could be used to serve up arbitrary Flash SWF files. This <a href="http://miki.it/blog/2014/7/8/abusing-jsonp-with-rosetta-flash/" target="_blank">technique</a> has known been used in the past to abuse JSON endpoints to allow Flash files to bypass browser cross-origin domain policies.</p>\n<p>WordPress core already has CSRF protection, but the WP REST API is oftentimes used in combination with other software which may not have the same protections. You can use a filter to disable JSONP support:</p>\n<pre class="brush: php; light: true; title: ; notranslate">add_filter( ''json_jsonp_enabled'', ''__return_false'' );</pre>\n<p>WP API project lead Ryan McCue credits <a href="https://iandunn.name/" target="_blank">Ian Dunn</a> in the release announcement for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability to the team.</p>\n<p>The WP REST API project is <a href="https://hackerone.com/wp-api" target="_blank">now available on HackerOne</a>, with a bounty for hackers who discover remote code execution exploits, SQL injection, privilege escalation, and other security issues. The <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/json-rest-api/" target="_blank">WP-API plugin</a> is listed as a high priority along with the <a href="https://github.com/WP-API/OAuth1" target="_blank">OAuth 1.0a server plugin</a>, which provides authentication for the API.</p>\n<p>The vulnerability fixed in version 1.1.1 of the plugin was classified as a minor security issue, according to McCue, and no sites have reported any exploits.

title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pressware-image-widget/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pressware-image-widget/">Pressware Image Widget</a> is a new plugin by Tom Mcfarlin, of <a title="http://pressware.co/" href="http://pressware.co/">Pressware, </a>that makes it really simple to add an image to a widget. While there are plenty of existing plugins that provide similar functionality, Pressware Image Widget stays close to the core of WordPress and is a no frills approach to the problem. The plugin is a result of a few projects Mcfarlin has worked on to provide clients an easy way to upload images through the media library into a widget.</p>\n<p>After installing and activating the plugin, you&#8217;ll need to browse to <strong>Appearance &gt; Widgets</strong> and locate the Pressware Image Widget. Drag the widget to a sidebar of your choice. When you click the upload button, the same pop up window used for inserting an image into a post will appear. You can either use an image that already exist or upload a new image to the media library. The image will automatically be proportionate to the width of the sidebar.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PresswareImageWidgetInaction.png" rel="prettyphoto[27142]"><img class="size-full wp-image-27168" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PresswareImageWidgetInaction.png?resize=441%2C676" alt="Assigning An Image To Pressware Image Widget" /></a>Assigning An Image To Pressware Image Widget\n<p>You can use multiple instances of the widget to display multiple images on the front end of the site. You can tell which image is being used in the widget by its title.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PresswareWidgetUsesImagetitles.png" rel="prettyphoto[27142]"><img class="size-full wp-image-27169" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/PresswareWidgetUsesImagetitles.png?resize=436%2C260" alt="A Good Reason To Use Descriptive Image Titles" /></a>A Good Reason To Use Descriptive Image Titles\n<p>One feature missing from the plugin that I&#8217;d find valuable is the ability to set a URL. This would make it easy to point people to a specific post using its featured image. Or, I could use a sidebar to highlight a collection of posts using images instead of text. Being able to set a URL for the image opens up more possibilities to use the widget.</p>\n<h2>The Business Model Behind Pressware Image Widget</h2>\n<p>The plugin is available for free on the <a title="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pressware-image-widget/" href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/pressware-image-widget/">WordPress plugin directory</a> but if you need support or want to access additional features, you&#8217;ll need to purchase the commercial version <a title="http://shop.pressware.co/image-widget/" href="http://shop.pressware.co/image-widget/">available on Pressware.co</a>. The pro version doesn&#8217;t have any distinctive features over the free one but that will change as Mcfarlin plans to release an update next month. Mcfarlin <a title="http://tommcfarlin.com/image-widget-wordpress/" href="http://tommcfarlin.com/image-widget-wordpress/">outlines the reasons</a> for two different versions and explains why having a free version will build brand awareness. However, he also mentions that the business model around the plugin is a bit of an experiment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To be honest, it’s all a bit of an experiment to see how it goes, but that doesn’t change the fact that a significant amount of effort has gone into trying to create a well-architected, lightweight, easy-to-use plugin that helps users add images to their sidebar.</p>\n<p>Whether or not this particular approach will work is yet to be proven, so I’m eager to see it play out.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I asked Mcfarlin how he&#8217;ll decide which features are added to the free or commercial product. &#8220;<span id="mailbox-conversation">In short, the plugin has a roadmap right now of a few more things to add. However, the majority of the features will be relegated to premium customers</span>&#8220;, Mcfarlin said. He plans on managing both products based on value. Despite being subjective, the more valuable features will be developed into the commercial product. Users of the commercial version are granted access to features first with an eventual delivery to the free version.</p>\n<p>Is this something you can see yourself using on client sites?

Many design-oriented sites, such as <a href="http://www.colourlovers.com/" target="_blank">ColourLovers.com</a> or <a href="http://design-seeds.com/" target="_blank">Design Seeds</a>, are devoted entirely to the concept of creating pleasing color palettes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/awesome-color-palettes/" target="_blank">Awesome Color Palettes</a> is a new plugin that makes it easy to display color palettes in WordPress content. The plugin allows users to create their own color palettes using a shortcode that passes a list of colors:</p>\n<p><code>[awe_palette colors="434858,5886c5,#f2674a,c6006d"]</code></p>\n<p>The shortcode is not sensitive, so you can include the # or not; it doesn&#8217;t affect the output.

You can see how easy it would be to curate your own list of beautiful color combinations.</p>\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s author includes a template tag if you want to add palettes to your theme. You can also create an awesome-color-palette.php file and add it to your theme folder to create custom palettes for whatever you need.</p>\n<p>The palettes can handle up to 10 colors out of the box, but the CSS is very easily to edit, should you wish to include more or desire to change how they are displayed.</p>\n<p>Saving your color palettes on a third-party website allows you to share them with other people, but there&#8217;s always the chance that you could lose all of your palettes one day if the service goes away. This plugin gives you a way to easily backup all of your palettes to your WordPress site. It also makes color-related discussions on your site more interesting and could easily be used with portfolios.

The idea was born when Katz decided to rewrite his popular <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-addons/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms Directory</a> plugin, which has received more than 87,000 downloads on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="http://wptavern.com/gravityforms-1-8-beta-released-introduces-api" target="_blank">Gravity Forms API</a> enabled the duo to create their own templating system that allows users to edit Gravity Forms on the frontend of their websites. GravityView is launching with a number of preset views that can be customized to display profiles, resumes, a job board, an issues tracker, business listings, and more. The plugin packages a drag-and-drop UI which allows users to fine-tune the view layout, and add/remove field entries and widgets.</p>\n<p>I spoke with <a href="http://www.rocketgenius.com/" target="_blank">Carl Hancock</a>, creator of Gravity Forms, who said that the GravityView team asked for his input from the beginning. &#8220;We think it&#8217;s great for our ecosystem just like all the free 3rd party add-ons,&#8221; he said, but noted that this product goes beyond a simple add-on:</p>\n<blockquote><p>GravityView is more of an App for Gravity Forms than an add-on. We view Add-Ons as plugins that provide integration with 3rd party services or add simpler enhancements and features to Gravity Forms vs. more of an app that adds a wide array of functionality.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Viewing form entries on the frontend of a website has been one of Gravity Forms&#8217; most requested features for a long time. Hancock has considered creating something along these lines in a much simpler form. &#8220;We did have plans to develop an add-on that allows you to display form entries on the front end of your site and we may still pursue that, but it would not go to the level that GravityView does,&#8221; Hancock said. For more functionality he would point customers to GravityView, in the same way he currently does for other third-party add-ons.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We encourage developers to create 3rd party add-ons because there are so many feature requests and 3rd party integration requests that it is just impossible for us to create them all in house,&#8221; Hancock said. In fact, the very existence of GravityView is the result of Gravity Forms&#8217; developer-friendly architecture. &#8220;From the beginning we&#8217;ve designed things to be extremely extensible with a huge array of hooks, filters and a complete API,&#8221; Hancock said.</p>\n<p>Gravity Forms users can expect even more apps coming their way in the future.<strong> &#8220;I know there will definitely be other commercial plugins designed to work with Gravity Forms that are apps and not merely add-ons because that is precisely what we plan on doing ourselves,&#8221;</strong> Hancock told the Tavern.

<a href="http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2014/07/24/site-logo/" target="_blank">introduced</a> a new site logo feature today with the goal of standardizing the way themes present logo upload. When it comes to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-shops-move-towards-preserving-data-portability" target="_blank">data portability</a>, you&#8217;re usually out of luck with logos. Ordinarily, when you change to a new theme, you lose your logo. Each theme developer has a different way of incorporating logo upload, but it&#8217;s not portable across themes.</p>\n<p>The new <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/site-logo/" target="_blank">site logo</a> feature allows you to optionally display the site&#8217;s title and tagline along with the logo, which will automatically appear on any of WordPress.com&#8217;s <a href="http://theme.wordpress.com/themes/features/site-logo/" target="_blank">supported themes</a>. All future themes will come with the site logo feature and WordPress.com developers are working to add support to previously released themes.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/site-logo.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[27070]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/site-logo.jpg?resize=555%2C346" alt="site-logo" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27082" /></a></p>\n<p>As WordPress.com moves to standardize theme support for site logos, the rest of the WordPress ecosystem may soon follow suit. The Jetpack team is <a href="https://twitter.com/kwight/status/492204961619398656" target="_blank">considering adding the site logos feature</a> into the mix after getting it running on WordPress.com, making it possible for self-hosted WordPress sites to enjoy logo portability. The availability of a standardized site logo plugin would improve data portability across the board, whether it comes through Jetpack or another community-supported plugin. It would also help theme developers everywhere to be more efficient when building products.</p>\n<p>Brian Krogsgard recently published a piece proposing that <a href="http://www.poststat.us/wordpress-com-jetpack-lead-way-toward-standardizing-custom-post-types/" target="_blank">WordPress.com and Jetpack should lead the way toward standardizing custom post types</a> so that users can easily move from theme to theme without losing data.</p>\n<blockquote><p>But if you have a post type for a portfolio, or testimonials, or staff bios, or something more generic, it could be a great thing to standardize so that different themes could support the same post type, which would result in better transitions for users from theme to theme.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Standardizing CPTs also helps theme developers create designs that can be used with any number of third-party extensions. Two plugins may use the same prefix to create testimonials and the user has the option the select the one he thinks is best.</p>\n<p>Standardizing theme support for logos is in that same vein. If you hope to be able to use this feature with self-hosted WordPress themes, keep an eye on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/site-logo" target="_blank">Automattic&#8217;s site logos repo</a> to see where it goes. If theme developers can make it easier for users to move from theme to theme, they&#8217;re likely to stick with WordPress and redesign more often.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 25 Jul 2014 02:16:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:64:"WPTavern: Hashcash.io Adds Support for Combating BuddyPress Spam";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=27021";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:174:"http://wptavern.com/hashcash-io-adds-support-for-comabating-buddypress-spam?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=hashcash-io-adds-support-for-comabating-buddypress-spam";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4628:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers1.png" rel="prettyphoto[27021]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/buddypress-wallpapers1.png?resize=800%2C450" alt="buddypress-wallpapers" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-16156" /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s no secret that BuddyPress sites attract a serious amount of registration spam. Plugins such as <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/buddypress-recaptcha/" target="_blank">BuddyPress reCAPTCHA</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-security-check/" target="_blank">BuddyPress Security Check</a>, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/si-captcha-for-wordpress/" target="_blank">SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pixeljar/BuddyPress-Honeypot" target="_blank">BuddyPress Honeypot</a> are either ineffective, inconvenient, or not well maintained. The often-recommended, though unfortunately named, <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/wangguard/" target="_blank">WangGuard</a> plugin is moderately successful at stopping BuddyPress spam, but is linked up to a commercial service.</p>\n<p>When a new plugin comes along with support for combating BuddyPress spam, community managers take note. This week we&#8217;ve been following the <a href="http://wptavern.com/hashcash-wordpress-plugin-makes-bots-and-spammers-work-for-you" target="_blank">Hashcash.io WordPress plugin</a>, which utilizes a unique approach to eliminating spam on registration, login, and comment forms. Pavel Karoukin, the project&#8217;s creator, has a <a href="http://wptavern.com/hashcash-io-reveals-strategy-for-capitalizing-on-spammers" target="_blank">strategy to capitalizing on spammers</a> by using the <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_work" target="_blank">proof-of-work</a> concept in combination with open technologies to generate <a href="http://dogecoin.com/" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> profits for site admins.</p>\n<p>In the latest 1.0.6 release of the Hashcash plugin, Karoukin <a href="https://github.com/hashcash/wordpress-hashcash/commit/a95d20e07f019c1e09c0b24f8e61b2587ca9122b" target="_blank">added support</a> for BuddyPress and sites that use <a href="http://diythemes.com/" target="_blank">Thesis</a> themes. The update adds the Hashcash unlock switch to the BuddyPress signup form, which uses a different registration process than the regular WordPress form.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/registration.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[27021]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/registration.jpg?resize=956%2C792" alt="registration" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27046" /></a></p>\n<p>The Hashcash plugin enables BuddyPress site admins to protect their registration forms in addition to login and comment forms. Keys for Hashcash.io are automatically generated within the WordPress admin, making it quick and easy to set up.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Hashcash.io stops spammers by forcing the user&#8217;s browser to do math. Hashcash plugin users have <a href="http://wptavern.com/hashcash-io-reveals-strategy-for-capitalizing-on-spammers#comment-57142" target="_blank">complained</a> about the painfully slow mobile experience. Karoukin is currently <a href="http://wptavern.com/hashcash-io-reveals-strategy-for-capitalizing-on-spammers#comment-57203" target="_blank">working on</a> an idea where calculations will be happening in the background, so that in most cases users will not be waiting on the browser. &#8220;Yesterday I brainstormed some ideas on how to make it even less painful for users (including mobile users.) The concept will stay the same, but UX will be different,&#8221; he <a href="http://wptavern.com/hashcash-io-reveals-strategy-for-capitalizing-on-spammers#comment-57185" target="_blank">said</a>.</p>\n<p>As far as BuddyPress spam-blocking plugins go, Hashcash is a fairly simple and relatively unobtrusive way to ensure that no bots register for your network. It also has excellent support for accessibility guidelines. The developer is very responsive to feedback and is continually evolving the plugin to become a truly painless solution on the human user end.</p>\n<p>If the project succeeds at reaching the critical mass required to make it profitable for website owners, BuddyPress site admins will be in a good position to capitalize on the steady onslaught of registration spam. In the meantime, the <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/hashcash/" target="_blank">Hashcash plugin</a> provides a decent method of deterring spam, even without the cash feature.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 18:58:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WPBeginner Reaches Funding Goal To Build Two New Schools";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=27011";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:176:"http://wptavern.com/wpbeginner-reaches-funding-goal-to-build-two-new-schools?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wpbeginner-reaches-funding-goal-to-build-two-new-schools";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1843:"<p>Earlier this month, WPBeginner <a title="http://wptavern.com/wpbeginner-turns-5-celebrates-with-campaign-to-build-two-new-schools-in-guatemala" href="http://wptavern.com/wpbeginner-turns-5-celebrates-with-campaign-to-build-two-new-schools-in-guatemala">hosted a huge giveaway</a> to celebrate its 5th birthday.

Richards is the lead developer of the <a title="http://wpstartbox.com/" href="http://wpstartbox.com/">Startbox theme framework</a> and is one of the organizers of <a title="http://2014.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/" href="http://2014.grandrapids.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> set to take place August 15-17, 2014.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPSessionsLogo.png" rel="prettyphoto[26987]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7588" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/WPSessionsLogo.png?resize=316%2C77" alt="WPSessions Logo" /></a></p>\n<p>WPSessions was launched in 2013 and provides high quality content to help train the greater WordPress community. Richards pays presenters for their expertise and time to give high quality presentations on an ongoing basis. Since the launch, there have been sessions on <a title="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/good-wordcamp-presentations/" href="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/good-wordcamp-presentations/">how to be a better presenter at WordCamps</a>, <a title="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/working-with-buddypress/" href="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/working-with-buddypress/">working with BuddyPress</a>, and <a title="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/security-for-developers/" href="http://wpsessions.com/sessions/security-for-developers/">security for developers</a>.</p>\n<p>The success of the site has even surprised Richards, &#8220;I had no idea WPSessions would catch on like it has. I thought it would just be a fun little thing for me to do on the side and learn lots of cool things.&#8221; The site generates revenue by selling tickets to each session. The majority of sessions are priced at <strong>$30</strong>. However, the site offers a <a title="http://wpsessions.com/vip/" href="http://wpsessions.com/vip/">VIP membership</a> account that allows members to download the entire library of sessions, participate in the community, and learn directly from professionals. VIP membership is <strong>$24.75/mo</strong>, making it cheaper than purchasing tickets to each session.</p>\n<h2>A Chance To Win A Trip To WordCamp San Francisco 2014</h2>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wps-give-away.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[26987]"><img class="size-full wp-image-27004" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/wps-give-away.jpg?resize=640%2C417" alt="The Big WPSessions Giveaway" /></a>The Big Giveaway\n<p>To thank VIP members that have supported the site, Richards is hosting an incredible give away. He will give one lucky VIP Member a $2,000 USD cash prize specifically so they can join him at <a title="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/" href="http://2014.sf.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp San Francisco 2014</a>. Richards describes his first time at WordCamp San Francisco as &#8220;beyond amazing&#8221; and wants to pass on the opportunity to someone else. He&#8217;ll also purchase three VIP&#8217;s a full-year membership to any other training site of their choice, up to $350 per membership.</p>\n<p>The giveaway is exclusively for VIP members. WPSessions has a maximum of 100 VIP accounts available. Richards told the Tavern, &#8220;only half of those are filled.&#8221; Even if all the VIP slots are filled, the odds of winning a prize are 1 in 25.</p>\n<p>The drawing takes place on <strong>August 1st</strong> but everyone who registers as a VIP Member <strong>by 11:59pm PST on July 31st, 2014</strong> is eligible to win.</p>\n<h2>The Future Of WPSessions</h2>\n<p>WPSessions continues to evolve and will soon offer courses. &#8220;So far, most presenters have been almost as excited about this as I am,&#8221; Richards said. The first of these courses is <em>Writing Your First Plugin</em> by <a title="https://pippinsplugins.com/" href="https://pippinsplugins.com/">Pippin Willamson</a>. In the future, a members only forum will be created to discuss courses, sessions, and client work. It will also be used to generate ideas and provide insight into what type of material members want to see. There&#8217;s also a members only discount section in the works.</p>\n<p>When asked what he thinks is his competition, Richards said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I have any competition, to be honest. I think of WPSessions as more of a compliment to things like <a title="http://webdesign.com/" href="http://webdesign.com/">WebDesign.com</a>, <a title="http://bobwp.com/" href="http://bobwp.com/">BobWP</a>, <a title="http://www.wp101.com/" href="http://www.wp101.com/">WP101</a>, etc, not a competitor.&#8221; The site has the support of several thought leaders in the WordPress community such as <a title="http://chrislema.com/" href="http://chrislema.com/">Chris Lema</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>WPSessions has a simple focus – to educate you by bringing incredible talent together to focus on specific topics you need to know. They could charge much, much more, but their focus isn&#8217;t on money as much as it is education.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Richards left a senior position at one of the most well-known WordPress development firms to focus on WPSessions. Despite not making the same amount of income, he&#8217;s committed to making sure the site becomes the best education resource for new WordPress users and developers alike. What <a title="http://wptavern.com/introducing-wpsessions-by-brian-richards" href="http://wptavern.com/introducing-wpsessions-by-brian-richards">started out as an experiment</a> is turning into an opportunity for Richards to achieve one of his lifelong dreams.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 15:21:52

This left developers with a problem: how do they take advantage of all the new features without leaving users of older devices stranded?</p>\n<p>For most developers the answer has been to support both older and newer devices. This requires a <strong>lot</strong> of work, but it&#8217;s worth it when it means many more people can use your software.</p>\n<p>The downside is this approach slows development, resulting in longer delays&nbsp;between releases. It also means developers sometimes don&#8217;t take advantage of the latest Android features, because doing so requires more time and testing to make sure the app continues to work on older devices.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve followed this approach for quite a while with WordPress for Android, supporting&nbsp;everything from the latest devices to ones running Android 2.3 (&#8220;Gingerbread&#8221;). At the same time we&#8217;ve been seeing the usage of our app decline on Gingerbread, to the point that it&#8217;s now less than 10%.</p>\n<p>This means over 90% of our users&nbsp;are paying a &#8220;Gingerbread tax&#8221; &#8211; waiting longer for new versions and not seeing features that take advantage of their phones &#8211; so that we can continue supporting older devices.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve decided to abolish this tax. Starting with version 2.9 of WordPress for Android &#8211; due later this month &#8211; new versions will only support devices running Android 4.0 or later. If you&#8217;re using an older phone, the previous version of our app will still appear in Google Play and you&#8217;ll still be able to use it.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll be honest: our developers &#8211; including myself &#8211; are happy about this because it&#8217;ll make us&nbsp;more productive. But the thing we&#8217;re the happiest about is that it will result in a faster, smaller, better&nbsp;app for the large majority of our users.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=apps.wordpress.org&blog=62767514&post=1037&subd=wpmobileapps&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 12:15:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Nick Bradbury";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"WP iPhone: WordPress for Android 2.8";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"http://android.wordpress.org/?p=1017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"http://apps.wordpress.org/2014/05/01/wordpress-for-android-2-8/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1898:"<p>We&#8217;re pleased to bring you WordPress for Android Version 2.8, which offers the following improvements: </p>\n<h2><a class="anchor" href="http://apps.wordpress.org/feed/#whats-new" name="user-content-whats-new"></a>What&#8217;s new</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>App startup time has been reduced, and the Statistics screen will load faster.</li>\n<li>The app is now available in Turkish, English (UK), and offers improved support for Traditional Chinese.</li>\n<li>Samsung users will now be able to use the app in multi-window.</li>\n<li>Notification and Comment screens have been reworked to enhance the user experience on small tablets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/issues?milestone=11&page=1&state=closed">GitHub milestone</a> for more info.</p>\n<h2><a class="anchor" href="http://apps.wordpress.org/feed/#download" name="user-content-download"></a>Download</h2>\n<p>Download it now from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android">Google Play</a>.</p>\n<h2><a class="anchor" href="http://apps.wordpress.org/feed/#thanks" name="user-content-thanks"></a>Thanks</h2>\n<p>A huge thank you to the contributors who helped make this release happen:<br />\n<a href="https://github.com/anirudh24seven">@anirudh24seven</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daniloercoli">@daniloercoli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maxme">@maxme</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mixpanelsteve">@mixpanelsteve</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nbradbury">@nbradbury</a>, <a href="https://github.com/roundhill">@roundhill</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sendhil">@sendhil</a></p>\n<p>Be sure to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/wpandroid">WPAndroid</a> for all of the latest updates.</p><img alt="" border="0" src="http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=apps.wordpress.org&blog=62767514&post=1017&subd=wpmobileapps&ref=&feed=1" width="1" height="1" />";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 12:15:12 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"Maxime";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"WP iPhone: Pull-to-Refresh and More Added in Latest Update";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"http://android.wordpress.org/?p=990";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:60:"http://apps.wordpress.org/2014/04/03/pull-to-refresh-update/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2258:"<p>The latest update of WordPress for Android is now available.

Here are some of the highlights of this release.</p>\n<h2>New Reader</h2>\n<p>The app Reader has been completely redesigned, and now provides a much-improved, native reading experience. You’ll definitely notice its speed — posts appear in a snap, and images fade in as they load. You can also view users that have commented or liked posts, as well as edit the list of tags that you follow. We’ve revamped the like, reblog, and comment interfaces to make it easier than ever to respond to posts that strike your fancy.</p>\n<h2>Redesigned Blog Setup</h2>\n<p>When signing in to the app or creating an account on WordPress.com, you’ll notice a brand new user interface that makes it super-simple to start blogging. If you keep multiple blogs on your account, they will all be automatically added for you. You can also hide whichever blogs you don’t wish to work on in the app.</p>\n<h2>UI Improvements</h2>\n<p>We’ve given the app a facelift, including a new color scheme, a refined navigation drawer layout, and sharp-looking lists in notifications, posts, pages and comments.</p>\n<p>You’ll also notice some changes to the post editor, with larger images and a new Post Settings area where you’ll manage post data such as status, post formats, and categories, among others. The post content area will now go full screen while you are editing, to give you maximum space to focus on your content. Give the app a try here:</p>\n<p>Download the update today from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.wordpress.android">Google Play</a>.</p>\n<h2>What’s next?</h2>\n<p>A big thanks to all of the contributors who worked so hard on this release: <a href="https://github.com/aerych">aerych</a>, <a href="https://github.com/daniloercoli">daniloercoli</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Jason-Chen">Jason-Chen</a>, <a href="https://github.com/maxme">maxme</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nbradbury">nbradbury</a> and <a href="https://github.com/roundhill">roundhill</a>!</p>\n<p>The mobile team isn’t stopping here!

At some point, that gained decent adoption, but people still tended to just package the same code that was in their theme and put it in a separate plugin &#8212; a fine practice for sure. But it&#8217;s not a practice that makes it much easier to go from one portfolio theme to another; rather it&#8217;s a good way to be able to keep your content and support it with custom templates in some new theme.</p>\n<h3>What does it mean to standardize custom post types?</h3>\n<p>At its core, a custom post type requires a registration name. It&#8217;s common practice to prefix custom post type names, just like is best for any other WordPress thing. For example, if you have two eCommerce plugins installed (because people do strange things), it wouldn&#8217;t be ideal for both to register a post type named &#8220;product&#8221;, because a conflict could exist.</p>\n<p>However, for many things, standard post type names make for better portability between themes. If you&#8217;re running eCommerce, it&#8217;s pretty specific to a particular eCommerce plugin. But if you have a post type for a portfolio, or testimonials, or staff bios, or something more generic, it could be a great thing to standardize so that different themes could support the same post type, which would result in better transitions for users from theme to theme.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com and Jetpack can lead the way</h3>\n<p>WordPress.com and Jetpack have a great opportunity on this front. WordPress.com has a ton of websites and is a significant player in the theme market; most WordPress.com theme makers also release their themes for self-hosted installs.</p>\n<p>As more WordPress.com themes begin to support more than blog-style content, WordPress.com is slowly enabling support for more custom post types. This means that WordPress.com &#8212; and Jetpack, it&#8217;s WordPress.org bridge &#8212; can lead the way in establishing some standardized custom post types for WordPress.</p>\n<p>Bailey and Designer are great examples of this in action. <a href="http://forefronttheme.com/">Forefront</a>, a business theme by Automattic, also has support for testimonials, which would work for their self-hosted version as well.</p>\n<h3>Current support for standard custom post types</h3>\n<p>Currently, Jetpack and WordPress.com support four post types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Testimonials</li>\n<li>Food menus</li>\n<li>Comics</li>\n<li>Portfolios (coming in the next version)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Really only portfolios and testimonials are mainstream styles of content. The other two were pretty theme specific add-ons, which Jetpack really just supported to aid transitions of .com users moving to .org.</p>\n<p>There are many common post types that Jetpack and WordPress.com could continue to enable, including but not limited to the following:<span id="more-6957"></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Locations</li>\n<li>FAQs</li>\n<li>Services</li>\n<li>Staff / Bios</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are many relatively common types of custom post types. And I&#8217;m beginning to think that some just don&#8217;t need prefixes, which would make them more transportable.</p>\n<p>This is the kind of common support that is easy to make global, or non-prefixed, and also easy for developers to opt out of. If, for some reason, a developer had a common CPT use case that wouldn&#8217;t work well ported elsewhere, they could still use a separate plugin with a prefixed post type, and theme users could account for that when they decide to use the theme.</p>\n<p>But for many common post types, I think not prefixing could be the way of the future; and I think Jetpack and WordPress.com are in a good place to support that.</p>\n<h3>What about metadata?</h3>\n<p>One of the concerns for this proposal is around meta data and custom fields. A custom post type often requires custom meta data fields to be registered, which are pretty core to the heart of the post type.</p>\n<p>Barring a more structured core <a title="The state of handling custom metadata in WordPress" href="http://www.poststat.us/state-handling-custom-metadata-wordpress/">meta data api</a>, this is a tricky issue. Different plugins name, store, and handle meta data much differently from one another, even if the field is relatively similar. For instance, a &#8220;job title&#8221; custom field could be handled many different ways from one implementation to the next, making common support for a custom field tough.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really have the answer to this. Do we prioritize what is important to standardize versus what is not? So, is the post type important to save but the metadata not so? I don&#8217;t know, and I lean towards not believing that. So maybe this dream of mine is limited to the most basic of fields in CPTs, or maybe Jetpack could strong arm the custom field naming conventions too. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n<h3>Build for the majority</h3>\n<p>No matter how we determine the specifics of standardization, it&#8217;s important to remember that we work for the majority. We need to make this easy on the end user, and as seamless between different themes and plugins as possible. That&#8217;s why I like what The Theme Foundry and Array have done with their new themes. They are making their stuff &#8220;just work&#8221; whether their user is on .com, .org, or moves from one to the other. Or, you could even go from one of their themes to the other, and it will work.</p>\n<p>I talked to Jetpack team lead at Automattic, George Stephanis, and he says their reasons for the support are mostly practical:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The main reason that we&#8217;re shipping the CPTs that we are is for compatibility with WordPress.com.  If there&#8217;s a CPT we use on WordPress.com, it&#8217;s going to be abstracted out of the theme it&#8217;s meant for, so that other themes can use it as well, so we try to get them shipped in Jetpack for users that want to move seamlessly between the self-hosted and WordPress.com ecosystems.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I talked to Mike McAlister about my concept, and he agrees as well:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I agree with this argument. If they [Jetpack] don&#8217;t, no one will and we continue down the road of non-standardization.</p></blockquote>\n<p>And I also asked Corey McKrill &#8212; developer at The Theme Foundry &#8212; about the details of their integration, and they took it a step further, by using the Jetpack CPT but not requiring it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class="p1">We believe the theme should &#8220;just work&#8221;, so we didn&#8217;t want it to require the full Jetpack plugin as a dependency. However, if the user does have Jetpack installed, the theme will use the code from the plugin, rather than the internal version. (We did something similar with the Infinite Scroll functionality in our Oxford theme.) And of course, in terms of content portability, if a user creates a portfolio with Bailey and then switches to a different theme, they can install Jetpack to continue having access to their projects.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p1">Corey also makes the good point that this notion of building on plugin functionality isn&#8217;t limited to custom post types; they did the same for infinite scroll in Jetpack. It does make me a little nervous to have CPT registration in the theme; but since it&#8217;s not locking the user in, this decision does make life easier on the user and give the most flexibility.</p>\n<h3>More thinking to do</h3>\n<p>There are details to work out; perhaps we need to create some best practices and standards around registering common post types. I sort of like the concept of adding common names to the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type#Reserved_Post_Types">reserved post types</a> list, but basically in the opposite sense &#8212; like recommended post type names.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think this is a standard where there&#8217;s a huge role for WordPress core to play. I think it&#8217;s mostly a decision that can be made by the market, and the biggest players in it. Obviously, Jetpack carries huge weight, but they aren&#8217;t the only ones. I&#8217;m interested in what other theme and plugin makers think, and also what developers think about chaining functionality to plugins like this.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 24 Jul 2014 04:50:44 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:9:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 10:49:57 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"150661";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 30 Jul 2014 10:30:14 GMT";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 249";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130910210210";}', 'no');
